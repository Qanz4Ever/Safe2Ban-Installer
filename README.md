# 🛡️ Safe Fail2Ban Blueprint Installer

A **clean, safe, and production-ready Fail2Ban installer** designed specifically for:

- **Pterodactyl Panel**
- **Pterodactyl Wings**
- **NodeJS Applications**
- **Game Servers** (Minecraft, Terraria, SAMP, etc.)

Built with a **MFSAVANA-Style UI/UX**, this installer focuses on **security without breaking services**.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ One-command install (**install → setup → done**)
- 🔐 SSH brute-force protection
- 🧩 Safe Nginx protection for Pterodactyl Panel
- 🎮 Game server friendly (no false bans)
- ⚙️ Wings & WebSocket safe
- 💄 Clean Blueprint-style terminal UI

---

## ❌ What This Installer Does NOT Do

This project intentionally avoids unsafe practices:

- ❌ No port scan detection
- ❌ No UDP inspection
- ❌ No aggressive bad-bot rules
- ❌ No manual iptables manipulation
- ❌ No Cloudflare dependency

Why?  
Because **most Fail2Ban guides break game servers and Pterodactyl Wings**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Most Fail2Ban setups online are made for **web-only servers**.

When applied to:
- Pterodactyl
- Wings
- Game servers

They often cause:
- False bans
- Broken WebSocket connections
- Random player disconnects

This installer solves that problem by using **only proven, safe jails**.
